Halley is the only known short-period comet that is regularly visible to the naked eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061 to 2062.",p2:"Halleys returns to the inner Solar System have been observed and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC. Clear records of the comets appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but, at those times, were not recognized as reappearances of the same object. The comets periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.","p3":"During its 1986 apparition, Halleys Comet became the first comet to be observed in detail by spacecraft, providing the first observational data on the structure of a comet nucleus and the mechanism of coma and tail formation. These observations supported a number of longstanding hypotheses about comet construction, particularly Fred Whipples dirty snowball model, which correctly predicted that Halley would be composed of a mixture of volatile ices—such as water, carbon dioxide, and ammonia—and dust. The missions also provided data that substantially reformed and reconfigured these ideas; for instance, it is now understood that the surface of Halley is largely composed of dusty, non-volatile materials, and that only a small portion of it is icy.","img1":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/57/PSM_V76_D018_Halley_comet_in_1835.png/180px-PSM_V76_D018_Halley_comet_in_1835.png","img2":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Halley%27s_Comet_-_May_29_1910.jpg/220px-Halley%27s_Comet_-_May_29_1910.jpg"},' +
    
     '{"name":"Hale-Bopp", "magnitude":"10.5","period":"2520yr", "diameter":"60km", "p1":"Comet Hale–Bopp (formally designated C/1995 O1) is a comet that was perhaps the most widely observed of the 20th century and one of the brightest seen for many decades.",p2:"Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp discovered Comet Hale–Bopp separately on July 23, 1995 before it became visible to the naked eye. It is difficult to predict the maximum brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty, but Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18 months, twice as long as the Great Comet of 1811, the previous record holder. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.","p3":"Bopp did not own a telescope. He was out with friends near Stanfield, Arizona, observing star clusters and galaxies when he chanced across the comet while at the eyepiece of his friends telescope. He realized he might have spotted something new when, like Hale, he checked his star maps to determine if any other deep-sky objects were known to be near M70, and found that there were none. He alerted the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams through a Western Union telegram. Brian G. Marsden, who had run the bureau since 1968, laughed, Nobody sends telegrams anymore. I mean, by the time that telegram got here, Alan Hale had already e-mailed us three times with updated coordinates.","img1":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/ba/Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg/200px-Comet_Hale-Bopp_1995O1.jpg","img2":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Hale-Bopp_sodium_tail.gif/220px-Hale-Bopp_sodium_tail.gif"}]}';
